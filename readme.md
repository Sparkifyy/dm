This is an funni little project made out of fun because i was bored.

I forgot to include an "help" command in this version so if u want to get the list of command then go to https://dm.kopal-host.xyz and click the "Docs" button.

Spark-DM stands for Sparkify Data Manager, it is coded entirely in Python and packaged using Pyinstaller. If you think the file is malicious then i can assure you it's not, you can even go through the code!
